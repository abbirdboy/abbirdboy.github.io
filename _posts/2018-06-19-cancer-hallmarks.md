This past quarter I had the chance to take a cancer biology class. Coming into the course, I knew cancer had something to do with abnormal cell growth. However, over the course of ten weeks I got a clearer picture of what makes cancer so complex and why it is so diffcult treat. 

On the first day of lecture, the professor introduced us to *six main hallmarks* that leads to oncogenesis:

 Underlying each trait are genomic mutations in key regulators that contribute to the characteristics typically seen in classical cancer. These tenements were central to our understanding of the disease.

This is what I imagine when I think of cancer -- unregulated and continous cell division. If you think back to high school biology, you might remember something called the cell cycle. It represents the four life stages most cells in our body go through: G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub>, and M. While some cell types may spend more time in one phase than others, they are all orchestrated by proteins in the cell that act as checkpoints. During S phase, for example, cells begin synthesizing new DNA in preperation for mitosis in M phase, but before the cell begins this process it will audit its own integrity for adverse mutations or damage. Furthermore, cells carry surface receptors that allow them to respond dynamically to their environment. Some of these act to influence cell growth through mitogenic signaling, which often interact directly with the checkpoint point pathways.

Now imagine if this checkpoint system failed to initiate growth arrest in the event of a mutation and instead allowed the cell to pass through each stage without restriction in the absence of growth signalling. Many of the genes that are involved in this mechanism are referred to as proto-oncogenes.
