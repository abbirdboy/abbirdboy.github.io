Hi, my name is Abhishek. I just graduated from UCSB with a degree in computer science and biology. I am interested in combining technology with medicine to do some really cool things. This blog is where I plan on sharing topics that I find exciting sprinkled in with some random posts about life. I've never had a serious blog before, so please excuse any silliness you find on here. Enjoy :)
