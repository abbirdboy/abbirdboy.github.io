Hello, my name is Brett. I write code. I listen to a lot of different music. I love Dallas sports. I play basketball. I play ukulele and guitar. I like [go](http://golang.org). I pronounce gif with a soft *g* like you're supposed to. I got my name from the [linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/106e4da60209b508894956b6adf4688f84c1766d/drivers/block/loop.c).
